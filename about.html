        <h1><u>Where I came from</u></h1>
        <p>
          I was born in Myanmar and raised in Malaysia. Coming from a humble
          background, I learned early on the transformative power of education
          in our lives. Growing up, I faced numerous challenges, but these
          experiences shaped my resilience and commitment to creating
          opportunities for others. <br /><br />
          After graduating in 2021, I volunteered and worked with organisations
          like <strong>Refuge for the Refugees</strong>, where I built strong
          connections with refugee communities better and gained valuable
          insights. <br /><br />In 2022, I co-founded
          <strong>Reimagine Education (R.ED)</strong>, an alternative learning
          platform empowering marginalised children in Malaysia. Currently, I’m
          pursuing a Master’s in Global Diplomacy at the University of London,
          where I’m growing as a global advocate and leader.

        <h1><u>Where I'm going</u></h1>
        <p>
          Most recently, I joined <strong> Fugee</strong> as a Project Officer,
          where I support higher education initiatives. Our organisation
          provides scholarships for refugees and stateless scholars, connecting
          them with internship opportunities, and for some even providing them
          with stipends to support their educational journey. <br /><br />
          In addition to this, I've been expanding my skill set by learning the
          basics of front-end and Python with
          <strong> Paper Airplanes</strong>, continually striving to upskill
          myself and stay adaptable in an ever-evolving world. learn and upskill
          myself.<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1><u>Meanwhile</u></h1>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy reading, day-dreaming, putting together a
          puzzle or a Lego... If I have even more free time, I'd love to do more
          creative pursuits such as writing, theatre acting, or do more fun
          photo shoots! That's a little about me; I'd love to hear from you! You
